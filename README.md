# secure_storage_application


## A web application that allows users to upload, store and retrieve large files (over 2GB) securely. The application should have a user registration and login system, and only registered users should be able to upload and access files. Each file should be encrypted using AES-256 encryption before being stored on the server and should be decrypted when being retrieved. Additionally, the application should have the ability to generate and send secure share links to other users, which allows them to download the files without the need to register or login. The application should also have a built-in feature that automatically deletes files that have been uploaded for over 30 days and send a notification to the uploader. The application should also have a feature that allow user to track their uploads and downloads and show the statistics on the dashboard.
